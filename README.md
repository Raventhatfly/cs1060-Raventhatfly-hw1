# Build Project
## What I worked on: 
I worked on setting up 2048 game from scratch and publish it.

## Issues encountered: 
The generated code is actually quite buggy. At first there is no use pushing the button, and after I told AI to fix it and ammend some code my own, the position of tiles are in the wrong place.

## Time:
It took me 40 minutes.
